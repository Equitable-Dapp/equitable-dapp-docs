# Data sources and preprocessing

## 1. Data Sources:

Incident Reports: The primary data source is the incident reports submitted by users through the DApp. These reports contain crucial information about incidents related to Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and Child Sexual Assault (CSA).
External Data: Supplementary data sources may include demographic information, law enforcement data, and geographic data. These sources provide context for incident reports.

## 2. Data Collection:

Incident reports are collected in real-time as users submit them through the DApp.
External data sources are periodically updated and integrated into the analytics platform.

## 3. Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure data quality and consistency.
Steps include data cleaning, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.

## 4. Geocoding:

Incident report data typically includes location details. Geocoding is applied to convert location information into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
