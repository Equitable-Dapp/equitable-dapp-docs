# Visualizations of GIS data

## Geographic Heatmaps:

Geographic Information System (GIS) data is used to create heatmaps that visualize the density of reported incidents in specific geographic areas.
Heatmaps help identify hotspots of CSA and CSA incidents, guiding targeted interventions.

## Choropleth Maps:

Choropleth maps color-code regions based on the severity or frequency of reported incidents. Darker colors indicate higher incident rates.
These maps provide a visual representation of incident distribution at regional levels.

## Time-Series Graphs:

Time-series graphs illustrate trends in incident reporting over time. Users can filter data by date, allowing them to identify patterns or spikes in reported incidents.

## Demographic Analysis:

Geographic data may be combined with demographic data to analyze incident reports in the context of specific population groups or socio-economic factors.
This analysis can reveal correlations between demographics and incident prevalence.
