# Reporting Incidents

## Reporting Form:

Users access the reporting form via the project's decentralized application (DApp).
The form provides a clear and user-friendly interface for users to submit incident reports.
Fields typically include a description of the incident, date and time, and any relevant details.

## User Authentication:

To maintain security and privacy, users are required to authenticate themselves using their Ethereum wallet addresses.
User authentication adds a layer of trust to the reporting process and ensures the credibility of incident reports.

## Confidentiality and Encryption:

The UI emphasizes the confidentiality of incident reports. Users are assured that their reports will be encrypted before submission.
A notice on the UI explains the encryption process, highlighting that sensitive information will remain confidential.

## Submission Confirmation:

After successfully submitting an incident report, users receive a confirmation message on the UI.
The confirmation message reassures users that their report has been securely recorded on the blockchain and is immutable.
