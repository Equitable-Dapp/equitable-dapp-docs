# Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the organizers of Equitable Elevation II 2023, EQ Hacks, for providing the inspiration and platform for us to embark on this meaningful project. Your dedication to promoting social justice, equity, and philanthropy has motivated us to create a solution that addresses critical issues related to Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and Child Sexual Assault (CSA).

Your commitment to fostering innovation, collaboration, and technology for social good has been instrumental in shaping our vision. We are honored to have been part of this hackathon, where we had the opportunity to develop a decentralized application, analytics platform, and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) dedicated to protecting the youth and advancing the cause of social justice.

We extend our appreciation to the entire EQ Hacks community, including participants, mentors, and judges, for their invaluable feedback, support, and encouragement throughout this journey. Together, we strive to make a positive impact on the world and contribute to a safer and more equitable future for all.

Thank you for your unwavering commitment to promoting positive change, and we look forward to continuing our mission with the values instilled in us through EQ Hacks.

Warm regards,

Equitable Dapp Team
