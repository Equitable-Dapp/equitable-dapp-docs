# Technologies used

## Programming Languages:

We have employed Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for Ethereum smart contracts, to implement the core functionality of our smart contract.

## Blockchain Platform:

The project is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which offers robust smart contract capabilities and a wide user base.

## Data Collection:

We utilize Python for data collection and preprocessing, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

## GIS:

For GIS capabilities, we incorporate open-source GIS software, such as QGIS, to handle geographic data.

## Smart Contracts:

The DAO's smart contracts are written in Solidity, similar to the smart contract used in the DApp.

## Kleros Protocol:

We integrate the Kleros protocol into the DAO for decentralized dispute resolution.
