# Data flow diagrams

## User Reporting Flow:

We have created data flow diagrams illustrating the process of a user submitting an incident report through the DApp. It includes data transmission to the smart contract and the subsequent immutability of the report on the blockchain.

## Data Collection Flow:

Data flow diagrams illustrate the journey of data from various sources, such as incident reports, external datasets, and geographic data, through preprocessing steps and into the analytics engine.

## Data Storage Mechanisms:

### Data Storage:

Processed data is stored in a dedicated database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to facilitate efficient querying and analytics.
Security Measures:

### Data Privacy:

We ensure that any personally identifiable information (PII) in incident reports is anonymized and stored securely in compliance with privacy regulations.
