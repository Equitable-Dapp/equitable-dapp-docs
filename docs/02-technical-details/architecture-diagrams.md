# Architecture Diagrams

## Decentralized Application Architecture:

Our DApp architecture comprises a front-end layer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It interacts with a back-end layer that communicates with the Ethereum blockchain through Web3.js. The smart contract, responsible for storing and processing incident reports, is a critical component within the Ethereum network.

## Data Analytics Platform Architecture:

The data analytics platform encompasses data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization stages. Python scripts are central to this architecture, orchestrating these processes.
