# Governance structure

The governance structure of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in your project is designed to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making.

## Governance Model:

The DAO operates on a decentralized governance model, allowing community members to collectively make decisions.
It follows principles of token-based voting, ensuring that participants have a say in project-related matters proportionate to their stake in the project.

## Roles and Responsibilities:

The DAO includes roles such as proposal creators, voters, and administrators.
Proposal creators are responsible for initiating proposals related to project actions or funding.
Voters participate in the decision-making process by casting votes on proposed actions.
Administrators have specific responsibilities, such as managing the DAO's smart contracts, ensuring security, and facilitating voting processes.

## Proposal Submission and Review:

Community members can submit proposals through the DAO's user interface. Proposals may include actions, expenditures, or strategic decisions.
Proposals undergo a review process to ensure compliance with project goals and principles.

## Voting Mechanism:

The DAO implements a secure and transparent voting mechanism. Token holders can cast votes in proportion to their token holdings.
Voting periods have a predefined duration, allowing participants adequate time to review and vote on proposals.
Votes are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
Quorum and Approval Thresholds:

Proposals must meet quorum requirements to be considered valid. Quorum is the minimum number of votes required for a proposal to proceed.
Depending on the importance or impact of a proposal, different approval thresholds may apply. Major decisions may require a higher approval threshold.
