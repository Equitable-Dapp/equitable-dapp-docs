# Participant Reward System

The DAO incorporates a participation reward system to incentivize active engagement and contributions.

## Token-Based Rewards:

Participants who actively engage in DAO activities, such as voting, proposal creation, or community discussions, earn participation tokens.
These tokens represent a stake in the DAO and provide participants with decision-making power.

## Reward Distribution:

Participation rewards are distributed periodically, typically at the end of each voting cycle.
The distribution mechanism ensures that active contributors are rewarded for their ongoing involvement.

## Enhancing Engagement:

The reward system encourages more community members to participate in the DAO's decision-making processes.
It recognizes and appreciates the efforts of those who contribute to the project's success.

The combination of a robust governance structure, Kleros integration for dispute resolution, and a participation reward system creates a dynamic and inclusive environment within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It empowers community members to collaboratively steer the project toward its social justice and equity goals while ensuring fairness and transparency in decision-making.
