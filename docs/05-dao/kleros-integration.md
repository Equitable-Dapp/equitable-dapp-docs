# Kleros Integration

Kleros integration enhances the DAO's dispute resolution mechanism, ensuring fairness and impartiality in decision-making.

## Kleros Protocol:

Kleros is integrated into the DAO to manage disputes and challenges related to proposals or actions.
Kleros employs a decentralized network of jurors who are randomly selected and incentivized to resolve disputes fairly.

## Challenges and Disputes:

In cases where there is disagreement or dispute regarding a proposal, Kleros is invoked.
Any community member can initiate a challenge, and the dispute is escalated to Kleros for resolution.

## Fair and Transparent Resolution:

Kleros jurors evaluate the evidence and arguments presented by both sides of a dispute.
Jurors' decisions are based on the merits of the case, and their incentives align with making fair and unbiased judgments.

## Enforcement of Decisions:

Once Kleros reaches a decision, it is enforced automatically through smart contracts.
The DAO respects Kleros' verdict, ensuring that the community accepts the outcome of disputes.
